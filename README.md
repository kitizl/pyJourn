# pyJourn
A python CLI Journal Program

This is a python journal program that allows you to type in your journal directly from your command line.

## Download
1. Get `python` for your system. No need to worry if you have use Mac or *nix.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Should be peachy.

## Usage
1. To run the program, type `python3 journ.py` in the terminal [just `python journ.py` if on windows].
2. Type directly into the command line the contents of you journal entry.
3. Press Ctrl+D on *nix or Ctrl+Z on Windows to trigger EOF to stop making entries.
4. You should see a timestamped text file once this is complete.
5. If the folder becomes too cluttered with text files, simply run `python3 organize.py` [`python organize.py` on windows] and
your posts will be segregated by year and month.

## Bonus Usage
1. If you have your entry stored in a file (preferably text file), you could do `python3 journ.py < [input-filename]` and it should work just the same.


Further functionality will be added in the future if I find the time and interest, really.
